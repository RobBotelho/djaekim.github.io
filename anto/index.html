                <p>We are interested in understanding the reciprocal regulation of membrane traffic and cellular signaling as it relates to regulation of the cell surface proteome. Specifically, my research aims to understand how signaling receptors uniquely employ and regulate intrinsically flexible and heterogeneous membrane traffic mechanisms and how the resulting spatial organization and localization of these receptors within membrane micro-domains confers to upon them unique s­­­ignaling properties. </p>


 
<p>
  Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is the principal mechanism for internalization of receptor-bound macromolecules (called cargo) from the cell surface. CME initiates by the formation of a large complex called a clathrin-coated pit (CCP) containing clathrin and numerous other proteins at a small, invaginating region of the plasma membrane containing cargo proteins bound for the cell interior. Following a still poorly understood maturation process, CCPs eventually undergo scission yielding clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs).
</p>
   
<p>
  Exciting new discoveries have revealed that CCPs/CCVs are highly heterogeneous: they exhibit a large range of different lifetimes at the cell surface, as well as differences in size and composition. Thus, CCPs are in fact an ensemble of different structures, each requiring a basic complement of certain proteins and membrane lipids (ie. clathrin and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, PIP2), yet further ‘customized’ to achieve specialized function. Understanding how the many lipids and proteins involved in CME contribute to the initiation, assembly, maturation and final scission of each subset of CCPs/CCVs is an exciting and important cell biological problem.</p>

   <p>

  In my lab, we focus on studying CME using many biochemical and cell biological techniques, in particular live cell fluorescence microscopy. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF-M) allows selective imaging of cellular structures in close proximity to the cell surface. As such, this technique is ideally suited to study CME. My research employs systematic computational image analysis of time-lapse images obtained by TIRF-M of cells expressing fluorescently labeled molecules in order to resolve their function within CME. We are currently studying how the dynamic regulation of specific membrane lipids, including phosphoinositides such as PIP2, regulates this process.

   </p>
<p>
  CME controls the cell surface content of a large number of diverse membrane proteins. As such, CME can be considered a master regulator of the cell surface proteome. Our research seeks to understand how CME integrates signals from multiple sources to gate the PM proteome. We aim to understand how receptor tyrosine kinases such as the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) effects changes in different subsets of CCPs, thereby controlling the internalization and cell surface content of many different cell surface proteins. Signaling receptors control many aspects of cell physiology, such as cell division and proliferation, metabolism, adhesion and migration, apoptosis, autophagy. Elucidating how signaling receptors control and are in turn controlled by their spatial organization within the cell may provide important novel insight into understanding and treating diseases such as cancer and diabetes. </p>
