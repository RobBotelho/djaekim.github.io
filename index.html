          <p> I have always been enthusiastic about technology. After all, without computer software and hardware, the level of success that humans have been able to achieve today would be unlikely. </p>

          <p> In June 2016, I graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Biochemistry. I felt relieved. I finally had the chance to attend another year of University to explore Computer Science. Today, I would say this was the greatest decision I have ever made in University.  </p>
      <p> The courses were unexpectedly interesting. Professors were dedicated and cared about student’s success. The class environments and projects fostered great collaboration and creativity. This was never learned previously and the best part about it was realizing that all I needed was a laptop. </p>
		  
		         
		  <h2 class="section-heading"> Today </h2>

            <p> In the past 4 months, I focused on learning web development. I am still nowhere near proficient in using MySQL, PHP and Javascript, thus I have been putting in tremendous time into them. I am currently working on 2 projects. One is about recreating a board game called Coup and the other is using Google MAP API to create a network MAP of Toronto tennis players.   </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading"> You Only Live Once. But, you get to serve twice </h2>

            <p> When I was asked about my major, I jokingly told people that I majored in tennis. This was supposed to be humorous because I put in as much time and effort into tennis as I did for studying. Tennis wasn’t just a sport, it was a way of life. </p>
            <p> I started playing tennis at the age of 10 and I still remember my father’s first lesson. He said, "If you want to be good at something you have to put in 1000 hours." </p>
            <p>He was an incredibly strict coach, criticizing my mistakes without a moment’s hesitation. The most important message I received from tennis was success comes from patience, preparation and learning from failures.</p>
